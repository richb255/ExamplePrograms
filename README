This project contains some sample programs that I havre created using Eclipse. The intent of this is to provide some publicly available code that show some of my basic capability as a software developer. It's also somewhat of a work in progress as I will be making changes and improvements from time to time.

Currently the following projects are available:

1. ChatServer - basic multi-threaded chat server implemented in Java.

2. ChatServer - the same as #1 above but coded for JDK 1.6.
